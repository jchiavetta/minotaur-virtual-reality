This repository contains work done for a course on virtual reality game programming I took during my master's degree. This course taught design principles in VR, detailing how to work with this unique medium to create experiences that are user-friendly and immersive. We learned also about the history of VR and current research done in the field.

On the implementation side, we carried out a number of game building projects using Unity and C# scripting. For this final project we were given the theme of "games with educational value". With this in mind, a teammate and I developed a short action-adventure game based on the teaching of mythology and history.

I have included in the repository an .apk that can be used to test the game by loading it into an Oculus Go headset. There are also supplemental materials we created throughout the course of the project: a game poster designed for display during a student showcase event and a video showing a short run-through of the game with commentary.

Finally, there is an in-depth written report detailing our design goals, implementation, and considerations for future work. Please see this document for more information on the game.
